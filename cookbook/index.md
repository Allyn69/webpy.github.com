# Web.py Cookbook

Cookbook style documentation for web.py 0.3. Note that some of these features aren't available in previous versions.  Currently version 0.3 is the development branch.

In terms of formatting, please try to use a cookbook-like format...that is:

###Solution:
bar

Note that the urls don't need "web" in them -- just "/cookbook/select" , not "/cookbook/web.select".
