# Code samples

## Simple samples

All samples are in the public domain. They are intentionally unstyled, and
they usually lack features that make them usable.  They are intended to show
how common patterns are performed in web.py.

* [Skeleton code](https://github.com/webpy/webpy-examples/tree/master/skeleton-code). The very basics required to get started.
* [Todo-list](https://github.com/webpy/webpy-examples/tree/master/todo-list). The simplest database-driven app possible.
* [Blog](https://github.com/webpy/webpy-examples/tree/master/blog). A very simple blog, showing basic CRUD functionality.
* [wiki](https://github.com/webpy/webpy-examples/tree/master/wiki). A very basic wiki engine.

## Real Web Apps

These are fully functional apps with code that have been built with web.py.
Note that these may be using older versions of web.py than the current release.
