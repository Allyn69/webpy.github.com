**web.py** is a web framework for Python that is as simple as it is powerful. web.py is in the public domain; you can use it for whatever purpose with absolutely no restrictions.

<div style="float: right; margin: 1em">
<pre>
import web
        
urls = (
    '/(.*)', 'hello'
)
app = web.application(urls, globals())

class hello:        
    def GET(self, name):
        if not name: 
            name = 'World'
        return 'Hello, ' + name + '!'

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
</pre>
<em>A complete web.py application.</em>
</div>

## Who uses web.py?

web.py was originally published while Aaron Swartz worked at [reddit.com][20], where the site used it as it grew to become one of the top 1000 sites according to Alexa and served millions of daily page views. "It's the anti-framework framework. web.py doesn't get in your way," explained founder Steve Huffman. (The site was rewritten using other tools after being acquired by Cond√© Nast.)
